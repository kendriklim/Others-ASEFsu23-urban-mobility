## Demo-Preview:


## Goals:
(1) Develop a concrete solution to support women’s access and safety to urban mobility, ready to be implemented in Lahore.

(2) Contribute to initiatives that facilitate more affordable, safe and gender responsive urban mobility in cities.

(3) Create a positive impact on women’s participation in society and gender equality, to promote accessible, sustainable cities & communities.

## Overview:
Urban mobility has become a staggering challenge faced by ever-expanding cities across the world. Congestion and public transport inadequacy, the lack of connectivity and infrastructure, accidents & safety issues as well as environmental pollution are some important factors which greatly impact people’s quality of life. Unequitable access to urban mobility also hinders socioeconomic prosperity, limiting access to education & job opportunities.

Almost 50% of Pakistan’s total 190 million population lives in urban areas, making it the most urbanised country in the Asia-Pacific. About two thirds of its urban population is concentrated in ten cities, which are witnessing an unbalanced reliance on a few modes of transport (private vehicles such as motorbikes & cars) and limited affordable mass transit options. Inefficient urban planning
policies and practices, coupled with urban sprawl and a lack of sustainable modes of urban transport have made mobility either unaffordable or inaccessible for a large segment of the society, especially low and lower-middle income communities, and people with disabilities.

Another key concern is the lack of safety in public transportation in Pakistan, especially for women and youth. According to a report by ADB, 31% of students, 23% of working women and 20% of homemakers decreased their use of public transport due to harassment. Among them, 40% avoid traveling after sunset which reduces their chances of employability and income generating opportunities.

According to a study by the Institute of Labour Economics (IZA), “many women [in Pakistan] avoid using public transport, particularly on crowded modes such as wagons. Women either switch to higher cost modes, adjust their travel timings and route or simply do not travel
without a male family member. These challenges restrict women’s lives substantially. They affect whether they work and the kind of jobs they take, where they can study and when they can visit their families. Women may have to give up better job opportunities that do not
provide transport – or they may not find a job at all.” 25% of women in Lahore said that better transport options would increase their chances of taking up a job opportunity.

## SDG Framework:
Urban mobility and transport systems are essential to the achievement of SDG11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), as emphasised in target 11.2.

Urban mobility also strongly contributes to SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) as it enables people to access job opportunities. The lack of safe, affordable and accessible mobility options often aggravates economic and social exclusion, particularly for people in vulnerable situations, including women, children and persons with disabilities.

Promoting sustainable transport and mobility can therefore play a critical role in building accessible cities and contributing to better employment, work and economic opportunities for everyone (target 8.5).
